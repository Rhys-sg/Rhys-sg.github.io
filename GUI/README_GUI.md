# Peptide Sequencing Simulation

Below is a list of amino acids forming a peptide. The graphical representations on the right represent the intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio generated from simulating mass spectrometry. The simulated mass spectrometry visualizes data points based on masses for fragments of the peptide. The fragments range in length from dipeptides (length 2) to the entire peptide. All fragments include either the C-terminus, N-terminus, or both if they represent the entire peptide. However, without sequencing the peptide, one cannot know if a fragment contains the C-terminus or N-terminus.

In the graphical representation below, the list of amino acids can be moved, which changes the simulated masses. Based on the masses of an end "Goal" peptide, reorder the "Current" amino acids to match the peptide.
