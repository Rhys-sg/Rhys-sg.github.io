    <h1>Peptide Sequencing Simulation</h1>
    <p>
      Below is a list of amino acids forming a peptide. The graphical representations on the right represent the intensity as a function of the 
      mass-to-charge ratio generated from simulating mass spectrometry on the peptide. Each mass is a peptide fragment. The fragments range in length 
      from dipeptides (length 2) to the entire peptide. All fragments include either the C-terminus, N-terminus, or both if they represent the whole 
      peptide. However, without sequencing the peptide, one cannot know if a fragment contains the C-terminus or N-terminus.<br><br> In the graphical 
      representation below, the list of amino acids can be moved, which changes the simulated masses. Based on the masses of an end "Goal" peptide, 
      reorder the "Current" amino acids to match the peptide. When an individual mass frequency is correct, it will appear green. Hover over the bars 
      to get the combined masses.
